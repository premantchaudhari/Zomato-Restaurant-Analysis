Title: Analysis of Zomato Restaurant Data using Excel, MySQL Workbench, Power BI, and Tableau

Description:

In this project, I analyzed a real-world dataset from the popular restaurant discovery platform, Zomato, using various tools and techniques. The project involved data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization using Excel, MySQL Workbench, Power BI, and Tableau.

The first step of the project was to clean and preprocess the data, which involved handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data formats. Next, I used Excel to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's various attributes, such as cuisine types, price range, and user ratings.

After performing EDA, I used MySQL Workbench to create a calendar table and used it to analyze the number of restaurant openings based on year, quarter, and month. I also used Power BI to create interactive dashboards and reports to visualize the data and insights.

Finally, I used Tableau to create a presentation that showcased the key insights and findings from the project, such as the top cuisines, cities, and restaurant chains based on various factors such as rating, cost, and location. The presentation was visually appealing, interactive, and provided actionable insights for stakeholders.

This project demonstrated my skills in data analysis, data preprocessing, and data visualization using a variety of tools and techniques. It also showcased my ability to work with real-world datasets and extract meaningful insights to drive business decisions.
